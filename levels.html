            <p>In "Battle Cats," players embark on an exciting journey through the "Empire of Cats," which is the first saga in the game. 
                This mode is unlocked from the beginning and consists of three chapters, each filled with unique challenges and a total of 48 stages. <br /><br />
                Chapter 1 introduces players to the basics of gameplay, where units cost 33.3% less than usual, making it easier to build your cat army. 
                As you progress to Chapter 2, the difficulty ramps up, and units return to their normal cost, while enemies become stronger with a 150% strength magnification. <br /><br />
                Finally, Chapter 3 presents even tougher challenges, with unit costs increasing by 33.3% and enemies boasting a strength magnification of 400%. Each chapter culminates in a boss battle, such as facing the formidable Teacher Bun Bun in Chapter 3, ensuring that players must adapt their strategies as they advance.</p>
